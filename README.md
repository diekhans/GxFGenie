# GxFGenie
Reading and writing of GTF or GFF3 genome annotation files.

THIS PACKAGE IS UNDER DEVELOPMENT.  GFF3 parsing is not functional

This provides a library parsing GTF and GFF3 genomic annotation files into
Python objects.  While it intends to a robust parser, with the ability to
selectively ignore errors, it should not be considered a validation
tool for either GTF or GFF3.

While there are multiple parser packages, many of them are of part of a larger
project or parse into other heavier weight structures such as Pandas data
frames or databases.
