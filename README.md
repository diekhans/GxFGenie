# GxFGenie
Reading and writing of GTF or GFF3 genome annotation files.

THIS PACKAGE IS UNDER DEVELOPMENT.

This provides a pure Python library parsing GTF and GFF3 genomic annotation
files into Python objects.  While it intends to a robust parser, with the
ability to selectively ignore errors, it should not be considered a validation
tool for either GTF or GFF3.

While there are multiple parser for GTF and GFF3 packages, many of them are of
part of a larger project or parse into other heavier weight structures such as
Pandas data frames or databases.  The goal is to provide a library for reading
and writing GxF files to/from Python objects.
